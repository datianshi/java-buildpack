# Gemfire module session with tomcat

## Topology

The module session embedded in tomcat would enable the http session stored in a gemfire data fabric instead of the tomcat. 
Current implementation supports gemfire client server topology.

## Gemfire module session bindary package
The buildpack needs to download the gemfire module session binary package from a public repo. Due to proprietary of gemfire software, we are not able to publish the package to the public repo. Detailed repo setup can be provided upon request
